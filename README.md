# About
Hi, my name is Deanna. I am a senior studying Business Analytics and Finance at Boston University, set to graduate in May 2026. Throughout my studies, I have developed a strong business foundation and a passion for working with complex data to identify patterns, uncover meaningful insights, and leverage analytics for decision making. 

I enjoy exploring new data analysis tools and techniques, and I am always looking for opportunities to expand my knowledge and skill set. Whether working on a team or independently, I am driven by the excitement of discovering new insights and the satisfaction of using data to solve real-world problems. Overall, I am eager to bring these technical and analytical skills to my future career.

This is a repository to showcase my skills and share my Data Analytics projects.
